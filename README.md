## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this challenge was to explore bikesharing data from NYC and see if we can learn if applying a similar program in Des Moines would be successful.

## Results
![Checkout Times for Users](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16244455/148658699-bdc4a07b-c299-4119-9e11-acd7642144e5.png)
Most trips are short trips, between 4-6 minutes in length.

![Checkout Times By Gender](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16244455/148658788-5f5019a7-e03d-47d5-93fa-614658776d4d.png)
Most trips are short trips across all genders, although Males make up the majority of the rides overall.

![Trips by Weekday per Hour](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16244455/148658830-401e616e-4102-4578-9533-0d7e43b3e1b8.png)
Most trips appear to be for commuting, as the most trips are during morning and evening rush hour.  However Saturday between 11a-6p also appears to be a popular timeframe as well.

Males appear to be using it mostly for commuting, while Females appear to using it on the weekends.

During their commutes, Males are using it more frequently on Thursdays and Fridays.

In general, evenings are the busiest.

The amount of usage each bike gets is spread pretty widely.

## Summary
Depending on how people in Des Moines commute, a similar type of bikeshare program could be beneficial to deploy. 

Other visualizations we could perform that would be helpful would be:
1. Look into trip length in terms of distance riden between starting location and ending location.
2. Look into trip volumes by Usertype to decide whether we want to focus on subscribers
